### Why Notion for group assignemnts documentation?

Trying to find an easier way to document as we go, we set up the Notion teamspace shared with the students, following the workflow below:

1. Document at the Notion group assignment page
2. Download as HTLM
3. Upload to the lab¬¥s Git Lab
4. Push it, using Notion format

Thanks to Omar Albalki Week 1 documentation from Techworks on how to use Notion for website building.
